## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwindcss

### What I learned

This project taught me a lot about intricacies of postitioning in css, this was also my inaugral with Rect REF and it was a brezze, time and again it just reassures how react is the silver bullet when it comes to frontend development.

### Continued development

There is still a lot of scope for improvement in this program, like 1-Cleaner Code, 2-Proper Posittioning
and I am set on improving upon those.
